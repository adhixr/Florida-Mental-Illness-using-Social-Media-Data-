# Florida-Mental-Illness-using-Social-Media-Data-using-NLP
Objective - Using NLP to detect mental illnesses among social media users in Florida.



In this study, we have extracted around 410K tweets from twitter for users in the state of Florida using snsscrape package based on 4 clusters of high population density. Relevant data from specific subreddits channels were pulled and formed a text corpus consisting of 310K posts which was used to train our multinomial logistic regression model. (This reddit data was sourced from the Journal of Medical Internet Research. Link in references of the report).

Post text processing using NLP standard techniques,this model was trained & the trained model was used to classify the 410K processed and cleaned tweets.

For our sample of 410K tweets, Analysis showed that Depression & Anxiety was common in all areas whereas suicidal thoughts were highest in Jacksonville and Panhandle regions of Florida.

Also, highest Schizophrenia sufferers were from the Jacksonville area whereas PTSD was common in the Miami and Tampa Clusters.

The Tampa region also had the highest Mental Health & Alcoholism volumes over the other clusters.
